One of my favorite games is Lethal Company. The game's goal is simple: you and a group of other players are tasked to traveling to distant exomoons that are often abandoned and picking up scraps. Well... almost abandoned. While trying to get scraps you have to avoid intergalactic monsters. On top of that, there are built in traps in certain maps and  natural disasters. 
Such a simple horror game storyline, but it is one of the best games I have ever played. Alongside the funniest.
