            <h1>Media that Every CS Student Needs to Consume</h1>
            <p>
                Staring at a screen for several hours at a time, posture replicating a shrimp's, and drinking Monster energy drink after another. That is the day-to-day life of most computer science students. The little leisure time is often spent doomscrolling endlessly through brainrot TikToks or Instagram Reels. As the name suggests, these videos will only rot one's brain. A lifestyle such as that would cause anyone to fall into a state of depression. From one comp sci student to another, you probably have felt lost, tired, and feeling worthless. We all know that we could do something better.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the past semester, I realized the key to my sanity: consuming media that actually educates me and nourishes my brain. We've all heard our English teachers in elementary school discuss the reasons to create media: to entertain, to inform, and to convince. A good piece of media does at least two of those. Only that is a media piece worth consuming.
            </p>
            <p>Let me tune your life a bit with some media that I have consumed in my life. Some media that you need to consume.</p>

                    <h2>"The Cathedral and the Bazar" by Eric S. Raymond (Essay)</h2>
                    <p>
                        What brought me to become a programmer was my 5th grade IT teacher. She taught me that programming was like Legos. You have pre-written code blocks just like the pre-built Lego pieces, but you can use them to create whatever you want to. I love analogies. Another one is Eric S. Raymond's. In this essay, Raymond explores the contrasting models of software development: the "cathedral" model, where code is developed in a closed environment by a small group of developers, and the "bazaar" model, which embraces open-source collaboration and community-driven innovation. Raymond argues that the bazaar model leads to more robust and flexible software, as it allows for diverse input and rapid iteration. This essay is a must-read for any computer science student, as it not only provides insights into software engineering practices but also emphasizes the importance of community and collaboration.

                    <h2>TIS-100 (Video Game)</h2>
                    <p>
                        If there is one hobby that most computer science students share is gaming. I don't blame you as an avid gamer myself. However, most games don't really teach you much. Valorant and Fortnite are not going to nourish your brain, trust me. TIS-100 is a unique puzzle game that immerses players in the world of assembly language programming. As you debug and rewrite corrupted code to restore the titular TIS-100, you’ll find yourself grappling with concepts like registers, memory management, and logic flow. This game cleverly disguises educational content within engaging gameplay, making it an excellent choice for computer science students looking to sharpen their programming skills while having fun. It’s a refreshing break from mainstream gaming, offering a challenge that will stimulate your mind and enhance your coding abilities.

                    <h2>"Inside the Mind of a Master Procrastinator" by Tim Urban (Speech)</h2>
                    <p>
                        I know everyone that is reading this has at one point waited till the day of to finish an assignment or project. Working against the clock to submit before 11:59 hits. Tim Urban wonderfully explains what goes on inside our minds. In this insightful TED Talk, Urban delves into the psychology of procrastination, using humor and relatable anecdotes to illustrate the inner workings of a procrastinator's mind. He introduces the concept of the "Instant Gratification Monkey," which distracts us from our long-term goals, and the "Panic Monster," which only awakens when deadlines loom. Urban's engaging storytelling not only sheds light on why we procrastinate but also encourages us to confront our habits and take control of our time.

                    <h2>"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep" by Philip K. Dick (Book)</h2>
                    <p>
                        This thought-provoking novel explores themes of humanity, empathy, and the nature of consciousness in a dystopian future where androids are indistinguishable from humans. As bounty hunter Rick Deckard navigates a world filled with artificial beings, readers are prompted to question what it truly means to be alive. For computer science students, this book serves as a fascinating exploration of artificial intelligence and ethics, encouraging critical thinking about the implications of technology on society and our understanding of what it means to be human.

                    <h2>"Digital Detox: The Silent Revolution of Our Time" by Camila Bindel (Article)</h2>
                    <p>
                        In this compelling article, Camila Bindel discusses the growing movement towards digital detoxing, highlighting the negative effects of constant connectivity on mental health and well-being. She explores various strategies individuals are adopting to disconnect from their devices and reclaim their time and attention. For computer science students, this article serves as a crucial reminder of the importance of balance in a tech-driven world. It encourages readers to reflect on their own digital habits and consider the benefits of stepping away from screens to foster creativity and mindfulness.

                    <h2>Cracking Enigma in 2021 - Computerphile (Video)</h2>
                    <p>
                        In this engaging video, the Computerphile team revisits the historical significance of the Enigma machine and the groundbreaking work of Alan Turing and his contemporaries in breaking its code during World War II. The video not only explains the mechanics of the Enigma machine but also delves into the mathematical principles behind cryptography. For computer science students, this video is a fascinating exploration of the intersection of mathematics, history, and computer science, showcasing the power of problem-solving and innovation in the face of adversity.

                    <h2>"The Internet's Own Boy: Aaron Swartz" (Documentary)</h2>
                    <p>
                        We are all gatekeepers. We enjoy keeping musical artists, niche hobbies, etc. just to ourselves to consume. However, there are certain things that should be free for all. For example, knowledge. This documentary chronicles the life and legacy of Aaron Swartz, a brilliant programmer and internet activist who fought for open access to information and freedom of expression. Through interviews, archival footage, and personal stories, the doc showcases Swartz's contributions to the development of the web and his tragic struggle against the legal system (which he did not deserve!). For every student, this documentary serves as a powerful reminder of the ethical responsibilities that come with academia and the importance of advocating for a more open and equitable digital landscape.
